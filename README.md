Ai/Ml tasks assigned by (DevelopersHub)
task 1 : In this task, I explored the Iris dataset using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. I loaded the data, checked its structure with .head(), .info(), and .describe(). Then, I visualized feature relationships using scatter plots, distributions with histograms, and detected outliers using box plots. This helped me understand the dataset and improve my skills in basic data analysis and visualization.
Task 2 : In this task, I used historical stock data from Yahoo Finance to predict the next dayâ€™s closing price. I selected a stock and fetched its data using the yfinance library. Using features like Open, High, Low, and Volume, I trained a regression model (Linear Regression or Random Forest) to forecast the Close price. I then visualized actual vs. predicted prices to evaluate model accuracy. This task enhanced my skills in time series handling, regression modeling, data fetching through APIs, and result visualization.
Task 3 : In this task, I worked on predicting heart disease risk using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. After cleaning the data, I performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends. I trained a classification model (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree) to predict whether a person is at risk. The model was evaluated using accuracy, ROC curve, and a confusion matrix. I also analyzed feature importance to understand which health factors most influenced predictions. This task improved my skills in binary classification, medical data interpretation, and model evaluation techniques
Task 6 : In this task, I predicted house prices using a dataset from Kaggle containing features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. I performed data preprocessing, including feature selection and scaling. Then, I trained a regression model (Linear Regression or Gradient Boosting) to estimate house prices. I visualized predicted vs. actual prices and evaluated the model using MAE and RMSE. This task strengthened my skills in regression modeling, real estate data analysis, and model performance evaluation.
